# Transfer notes between MacOS Notes App and Google Keep

## About
This is script to transfer your notes between Notes App on your Mac and your Google account (Google Keep app). I am not Python developer so it is probably not best possible Python code ðŸ˜…  If you would like to use it just create credentials.yml file with credentials to your Google account. 

It is using [gkeepapi](https://gkeepapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as there is no official Google Keep API at the moment.

I built that to transfer lots of notes I did on my Mac and I needed them on my Android device.

## How to run?
```
python3 script.py
```
